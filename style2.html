        <h2>Don't Mess with a Drop Bear</h2>
        <article>
          <img src="mean-koala.png" class="mean-koala art-img">
          <p>Drop bears are commonly said to be unusually large, vicious,
            carnivorous marsupials related to koalas that inhabit treetops
            and attack their prey by dropping onto their heads from above.</p>
 
            <p>Koala drop bears are about the size of a very large dog, have
              coarse orange fur with dark mottling, have powerful forearms for
              climbing and attacking prey, and bite using broad powerful premolars
              rather than canines. They weigh 120 kilograms (260 lb) and have
              a length of 130 centimetres (51 in).</p>
 
              <p>A 2012 paper published in the Australian Geographer<sup>
               <a href="http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/drop-bears-prefer-travellers-says-study.htm"
               alt="Drop Bear Article">
               <span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> found that
               "Drop Bears target people with foreign accents more often than
               those who are Australian-born."</p>
 
               <p>The study, conducted in a drop-bear hot-spot in New South Wales,
                 aimed to gather data around the behaviour and ecology of the
                 elusive species.</p>
 
                 <p>There has been relatively little scientific research into the
                   drop bear (Thylarctos plummetus), which the Australian Museum
                   describes as a "large, arboreal, predatory marsupial related to
                   the koala." Populations are thought mainly to exist in forested
                   coastal regions of eastern and southern Australia, stretching
                   from the Cape York Peninsula to Tasmania.</p>

                <h2>Jackalopes are Real Frightening</h2>
                <article>
                  <img src="jackalope.png" class="jackalope art-img">
                  <p>There are two versions of the jackalope. The first is
                    taxidermy version created by Douglas Herrick and his brother.
                    It is created by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass.
                    Stuffed and mounted, jackalopes are found in many bars and other
                    places in the United States.</p>
 
                    <p>The second version, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were
                      building, is very frightening indeed! The cute Jackalope was inspired
                      by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus.</p>
 
                      <p>Shope papilloma virus infects rabbits, causing keratinous carcinomas,
                        typically on or near the animal’s head. These tumors can become large
                        enough that they interfere with the host’s ability to eat, eventually
                        causing starvation. I let it to you whether you want to see the truly
                        frightening version of the "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rabbit+papillomavirus&espv=2&biw=1002&bih=749&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=HPpMVaybFajnsAT5l4DQDw&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ"
